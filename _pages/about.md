I'm a third-year Computer Science PhD student studying formal methods at the University of Southern California (USC), advised by Prof. [Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/).  My research interests are in abstract interpretation, specifically in automating the challenging aspects of software verification and the design of verification tools.  I am also interested in using formal techniques to improve
the quality and security of LLM-generated code.

I am also a Operations Team Member at [SIGPLAN-M](https://www.sigplan.org/LongTermMentoring/), a wonderful group which pairs up mentors and mentees in the PL community.  Check it out!

Prior to USC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from UC Davis, where I was advised by Prof. [Aditya V. Thakur](https://thakur.cs.ucdavis.edu/).

Here's my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZiZr_js2oZLdDaQCyerNOg9kHUoYJ_-/view?usp=sharing)!
