I'm a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California (USC), advised by Prof. [Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/).

My research interests lie in applying techniques from formal methods and programming languages to improve the safety and reliability of software.  Recently, I've been working on safe deep learning!

Prior to USC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from UC Davis, where I was advised by Prof. [Aditya V. Thakur](https://thakur.cs.ucdavis.edu/).

Here's my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZiZr_js2oZLdDaQCyerNOg9kHUoYJ_-/view?usp=sharing)!
