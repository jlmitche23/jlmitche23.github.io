This page is for the CSCI 698 Video Teaching Assignment

## VIDEO LINK:

This is the link to my teaching video [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORZNbtgr24N6QqTlEI_qok-AG60ZZ3JL/view?usp=sharing).  I also embedded it below. The topic is on Different Types of Reasoning (Inductive, Deductive, and Abductive) and their applications in computer science!

I was not able to upload the video to github, because it exceeded 100 MB.  So, instead, I uploaded it to Google drive.  To confirm that the file is the version that I submitted on time here is the checksum using SHA-256 of the video `CSCI698_TeachingVideo_JacquelineMitchell.mp4`:

``84bc1d1389fc5f24b69b5a680806c8ce493193e85faaf3f57f9c153b1edc9892``.

To check the hash on MacOS/Linux: `shasum -a 256 CSCI698_TeachingVideo_JacquelineMitchell.mp4`
To check the hash on Windows: `certutil -hashfile CSCI698_TeachingVideo_JacquelineMitchell.mp4 SHA256`

The checksum + the github commit time for `_pages/csci-698-teaching-video-assignment.md` should prove everything was uploaded on time.  (There is also the created and modified timestamps on Google Drive).

The video is also embedded here:
